##abstract
**this is a numberical solution of problem_1.5 of Nicholas J. Giordano's computational physics**
##background
**In chapter_01 of *computational physics*,we learn how to program to solve a radioactive decay problem.
class and object skills of python,matplotlib and Euler's method of math,all these skills would suffice for us to 
work out a satisfying solution to this kind of problem.
We can practice the methods we learned by program to solve some similar problems,problem_1.5 is one of them.**
##main body
###1.solution to problem_1.5
**[here is the code](https://github.com/OrionPaxxx/computational_physics_N2014301020039/blob/master/exercise_04/-----problem_1.5_of_computational_physics.py).
the code can be divided into two parts,part_01 and part_02.part01 could reach a numerical result to the problem,part02
is applied to test whether or not the result is reasonable.**
